# Quick app to practice using React Query

## To run the server

**(Do this first!)**

1. `cd` into the `example-app/back-end` folder
2. `npm i`
3. Run `npm start` to start the server on port 8000
4. You can now send requests to <http://localhost:8000/todos>

## To run the front end

1. `cd` into the `example-app/front-end` folder
2. Run `npm start` to start the front end locally on port 3000
3. View the front end on <http://localhost:3000>

You'll need the server running as well (in a separate terminal) for the front end to work correctly.
